# Database Backup Tool

## Overview

The Database Backup Tool is a Python-based utility for backing up database views. It allows users to backup all views from a specified MySQL database either to their local machine or to an AWS S3 bucket.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Access to a MySQL database
- (Optional) AWS account for S3 backups

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Tool:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

2. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the tool and run:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Configuration

1. **Database Configuration:**
   - Create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the tool with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
         "database": {
             "host": "your_db_host",
             "user": "your_db_user",
             "password": "your_db_password",
             "db_name": "your_db_name"
         },
         "aws": {
             "access_key": "your_aws_access_key",
             "secret_key": "your_aws_secret_key",
             "bucket_name": "your_s3_bucket_name"
         }
     }
     ```
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual database and AWS credentials.

2. **Security Note:**
   - **Do not** commit your `config.json` file to version control if it contains sensitive information. It is recommended to use environment variables or a secure vault for storing sensitive credentials in a production environment.

## Usage

1. **Running the Tool:**
   - To run the tool, use the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     python backup_tool.py --config-file path/to/config.json --storage-choice [local/s3]
     ```
   - Replace `path/to/config.json` with the actual path to your configuration file.
   - Choose `local` or `s3` for the storage choice depending on where you want to save the backup.

2. **Backup Output:**
   - If you choose `local`, the backup will be saved in the same directory as the tool.
   - If you choose `s3`, the backup will be uploaded to the specified AWS S3 bucket.
